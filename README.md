This project aims to develop a predictive model for early-stage Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using machine learning techniques. The approach involves utilizing Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms to analyze a dataset containing various features indicative of cognitive impairment.

The project includes the following key components:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis, addressing issues such as missing values and feature normalization.

Model Training: Both Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers are trained on the processed dataset, with careful attention to balancing the classes and avoiding overfitting.

Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1 score to assess their performance on a separate test set.

Result Comparison: The performance of the two algorithms is compared to determine the most effective model for predicting early-stage Alzheimer's, utilizing visualizations like bar graphs for clear representation.

Through this project, the goal is to provide a reliable tool for early detection of Alzheimer's disease, ultimately contributing to better patient management and treatment planning.
